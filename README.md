Athena test implementation

To start project:

go to medical-billing folder and enter ng serve

to start backend server:

D:\Angular\medical-billing\src>json-server --watch db.json

if needed, clear db.json file under the above path t start afresh for node_modules: go the medical-billing folder and enter npm for getting the dependencies
